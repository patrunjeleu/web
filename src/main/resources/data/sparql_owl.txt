ADDITIONAL NOTES FOR PROTÉGÉ/GRAPHDB EXECUTION:
-----------------------------------------------
- Load the vacation-ontology.owl file into Protégé or GraphDB before running queries
- For Protégé: Use the SPARQL Query tab (Window > Tabs > SPARQL Query)
- For GraphDB: Create a repository and import the OWL file, then use the SPARQL tab
- These queries work with both the asserted ontology and the inferred ontology
- After running a reasoner, additional implicit relationships may be discovered
- Screenshot the results window showing the query execution and results table
